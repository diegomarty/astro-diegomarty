## Introduction to web development

Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a combination of front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) development, and may also include database management and other tasks.

Web developers use a variety of technologies and tools, including:

- **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language): The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets): A stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.
- **JavaScript**: A programming language commonly used in web development to add interactivity to websites.

There are three main types of web development:

- **Front-end development**: Also known as client-side development, this involves creating the user interface and overall look and feel of a website or web application.
- **Back-end development**: Also known as server-side development, this involves creating the underlying functionality and logic of a website or web application, including server-side scripting, database management, and API development.
- **Full-stack development**: This involves both front-end and back-end development, and requires a more comprehensive set of skills.
